    steps='''So you want to get into hacking but you are confused as to where to begin? Here is what I recommend:
1. __**Effort:**__ Effort is necessary anywhere. I recommend that you start reading up about things constantly.
2. __**Be curious:**__ Be fucking curious about everything!
3. __**Google is your fuck buddy:**__ A person I respected and idiolized back in my skid days told me that. It simply means
that you should Google EVERYTHING you can. Indeed there are things that you won't understand. But try can do is try your best to understand it. Slam your head against it for time maybe kek.
4. __**Pick up a coding Language:**__ Programming is important in hacking. I mean you CAN hack without knowing how to code but it limits you and you would have a harder time with things. You can pick up any programming language that you prefer. Python, C++, C# or Javascript etc. If you're worried about how to pick that up, I have a whole article dedicated to just that here: 

<https://medium.com/@0x0elliot/how-to-learn-your-first-programming-language-to-get-into-hacking-2112d9885025>

5. __**Get into infosec communities:**__ This is equally as important. If you're the smartest person in the room, then you are in the wrong room. Find yourself a place where you aren't the smartest. Accept your flaws and grow there. Besides Gateway itself, I can recommend you some great communities you can join:
'''
    steps2='''Good Cybersecurity/Infosec servers with smart people and a non-toxic community where you can grow in given that you aren't ego filled and are always humble: 

LHC: https://discord.gg/bavNVtP
Crow's Nest: https://discord.gg/tMRrYzd

LHC has some great resources and a whole proper website. You can check that there as well.

Good Programming server to join where you will get help related to your programming queries:

Coding Support: https://discord.gg/Nsf7SdZ

Honestly, I will always give these guys a shoutout. I genuinely think that this is a great community. Coding Support server always ends up helping me.

6. __**CTFs, CTFs, CTFs:**__ Can't stress this enough. CTFs will teach you a lot. There are a lot CTFs you can do. Just don't run away from them. Keep trying. It's okay to see the solutions to your CTFs sometimes, Especially initially. 

CTFs I recommend for absolute beginners:
 
The ones at LHC [I love this server] kek (The CTFs go from easy to Hard as you solve each chronologically. I still haven't completed Unsanitary :( )
The Crypto ones and initial RE ones at Crow's Nest
Hacker101: <https://www.hacker101.com/>
PicoCTF: <https://picoctf.com/>

Watch some liveoverflow beginner videos to understand the basics of hacking. Look that up on youtube. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lus7aNf2xDg

^ here liveoverflow explains how to learn hacking with CTFs. Though do this after you have picked up some basic hacking from the other CTFs and you know some programming.

These are the ones that I found useful in my rookie days. I would recommend looking into bug bounties and trying to find and report vulnerabilities. It helps you formulate an approach of your own. Infact the LHC CTFs are perfect in helping you do just do that. Best of luck!
