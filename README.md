<h1>WhiteRose</h1>
<p>
Discord bot written by <a href="https://github.com/0x0elliot">0x0elliot</a> which is used at Gateway.<br>
We chose to make it public because we wanted to be critised and we wanted people to contribute.
</p>
<h2>Features:</h2>
<b>1. A verification system to filter skids:</b> Not the safest method. We will be making use of CAPTCHAs in the near future but this would still stay.<br>
<b>2. Basic filtering:</b> You can't filter everything, But we tried to filter most things in a very basic way.<br>
<b>3. Fun little inside jokes:</b> That you will have to figure out yourself by being in the community.<br>
<b>4. Moderation: </b> Has every moderation feature we need.<br>
<br>
<b>ps the bot is privated and can't be added to another server. If you would like to use it for your own server, you would have to fork it and make the necessary changes.</b>
